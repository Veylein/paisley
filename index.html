          Ainu people live in Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Island. They
          like environments like coastline, forest, and river, where they
          hunted, fished, gathered, and cultivated land. The Ainu built houses
          called chise that were made of natural materials such as trees, bamboo
          grass, or reeds, tied together with plants such as grape vines. The
          four-sided roofs were slanted down to allow snow to slide off, and
          vents at the top enabled smoke from the hearth to escape. A separate
          raised structure for food storage was close to the chise.

          Ainu cuisine is characterized by its reliance on hunting, gathering,
          and fishing, with a focus on seasonal and regional ingredients.
          Traditional Ainu dishes often feature salmon, deer, bear, and various
          wild plants and berries. Ohaw (soup) and rataskep (simmered dish) are
          central to Ainu food culture. Their special environment not only
          affects their food, but it also affects their clothing. The matanpushi
          (Ainu/Japanese: マタンプシ) is a traditional garment. The matanpushi
          is a traditional, embroidered headband worn by Ainu women,
          particularly during ceremonies. While originally worn by both men and
          women, it's now primarily associated with women, complementing the
          sapanpe, a crown worn by men in Ainu ceremonies.

          If you are amoung the Ainu, you will be immersed in a culture deeply
          connected to nature. Traditional Ainu communities relied on hunting,
          fishing, and gathering, with a strong spiritual belief system rooted
          in animism—the idea that all things, from animals to rivers, have
          spirits. You might participate in ceremonies honoring bears or salmon,
          which are considered sacred.
